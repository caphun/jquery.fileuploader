Yet Another File Uploader
-------------------------

This file uploader uses a generic API for file uploading that's supported by any programming language given a vendor script is available.

At this point the plugin provides an indeterminate progress indicator only. I will be exploring the use of APC, Sessions and Memecache to provide upload progress percentages without the use of Flash.

The vendor folder is where all backend magic lives. At the moment it only contains PHP but the idea here is to build-up a repository of vendors for other languages.
